                    Built by Sultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah in years 1887–1891, the palace was designed by the Dutch architect Theodoor van Erp and covers 2,772 m² with a total of 30 rooms.

                    Maimoon Palace or Maimun Palace is a royal palace of the Sultanate of Deli and a well-known landmark in Medan, the capital city of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia. Today, it serves as a museum. <br><br>
                    Built by Sultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah in years 1887–1891, the palace was designed by the Dutch architect Theodoor van Erp and covers 2,772 m² with a total of 30 rooms. The Palace has become a popular tourist destination in the city, not solely because of its historical heritage status, but also because of its unique interior design of the palace, combining elements of Malay cultural heritage, Islamic and Indian architecture, with Spanish and Italian furniture and fittings. <br><br>
                    The color that dominates is yellow because yellow is considered the color of the greatness of the Deli Kingdom in North Sumatra as well as symbolizing the color of Malay. There are three parts in Maimun Palace, namely the main part and two more on the left and right wings. In the main part, there is a large room that was once used for traditional activities. Now, it is used to view the collection of royal relics. <br><br>
                    What's more interesting there is the existence of a small building with a thatched roof on the right side of the palace. There is a Meriam Puntung which is also called Meriam Buntung with the legend of the incarnation of a beautiful princess. Meriam Puntung is the incarnation of Putri Hijau's sister from the Old Deli Kingdom named Mambang Khayali who was beautiful.
