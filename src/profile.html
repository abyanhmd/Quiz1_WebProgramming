            Hi! My name is Abyan Ahmad and I am an undergraduate student in Informatics Department, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.
            I was born and grown up in Medan, North Sumatera. I have ever used Unity 3D before when I was in High School to make a simple game by myself. I did not code 
            anything in there because I did not understand about programming. That problem leads my way to choose Informatics as my Major.<br><br>
            Right now, when I am in Informatics Department, I do not think that I want to focus on game development because I am interested in
            something else. I am interested in both Cyber Security, because it was what I want to learn since I was younger, and UI Designing, because it satisfies me when 
            I use an application or a website if the interface is well designed. This web interface is my second attempt on making front end and I am still learning.<br><br>
